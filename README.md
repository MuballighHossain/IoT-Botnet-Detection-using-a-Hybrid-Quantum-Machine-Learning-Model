# IoT-Botnet-Detection-using-a-Hybrid-Quantum-Machine-Learning-Model
Botnets are harmful software or malware that infect computers in various ways. Cyber
thieves employ specific Trojan horses to breach the security of multiple usersâ€™ comput-
ers and take control of a collection of infected workstations. These botnets are capable
of committing a wide range of cybercrimes, including DDoS assaults, virus distribution,
online fraud, and large-scale spam or phishing operations. Botnets have evolved from
attacking PCs to vulnerable IoT devices. Botnets like Mirai have generated large DDoS
attacks on well-known companies and devices and caused a lot of damage. So, it is very
important to study these new IoT botnets to prevent future attacks.
Almost all ancillary devices in our homes and offices are internet enabled. This makes
these devices susceptible to regular DDoS attacks through available open channels like
NTP, LDAP and SNMP. In this paper we hope to look into how IoT based botnets work
and try to explore quick methods for their detection. We hope to do so by using a hybrid
quantum machine learning model which yields significantly better results compared to its
classical counterpart.
This research aims to develop an advanced detection algorithm based on a hybrid quantum machine learning model. This model takes the classical machine learning model and adds a quantum layer to it, ensuring better performance overall. We hope our model aids in a more robust and more responsive detection system to protect IoT devices.
